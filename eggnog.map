2	COG0002 N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde dehydrogenase
3	COG0003 ATPase required for the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors, where the tail- anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the membrane-bound receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting (By similarity)

The reaction is reversible (By similarity). Binds transferrin, lactoferrin, heme, hemoglobin, hemin, fetuin, asialofetuin and protein A. Also binds fibronectin and chains B- beta and gamma of fibrinogen, promoting clumping of S.aureus with fibrinogen. Was also shown to adhere to plastic (By similarity). Inactivation of isdA leads to a decrease both in the amount of heme-iron associated with S.aureus cells and the amount of heme- iron that enters the staphylococcal cytoplasm. This suggests that IsdA could play a role in the removal of heme from hemoglobin. It was also demonstrated that the IsdA-mediated iron-acquisition system from transferrin could play only an ancillary role in the iron uptake whereas the siderophore-mediated iron-acquisition system from transferrin seems to play an essential or dominant role. Overexpression of isdA enhances S.aureus growth and an isdA inactivation mutant shows a growth defect when grown in liquid medium containing heme as the sole iron source which suggests that IsdA may function as a cell surface reservoir for heme. Involved in adherence of S.aureus to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells and is required for nasal colonization. Protects S.aureus against the bactericidal protease activity of apolactoferrin in vitro and confers resistance to bovine lactoferricin.

5391	COG5391 sorting nexin
5398	COG5398 Heme oxygenase
5404	COG5404 Component of the SOS system and an inhibitor of cell division. Accumulation of SulA causes rapid cessation of cell division and the appearance of long, non-septate filaments. In the presence of GTP, binds a polymerization-competent form of FtsZ in a 1 1 ratio, thus inhibiting FtsZ polymerization and therefore preventing it from participating in the assembly of the Z ring. This mechanism prevents the premature segregation of damaged DNA to daughter cells during cell division (By similarity)
5405	COG5405 Protease subunit of a proteasome-like degradation complex believed to be a general protein degrading machinery (By similarity)
5406	COG5406 Component of the FACT complex, a general chromatin factor that acts to reorganize nucleosomes. The FACT complex is involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. During transcription elongation the FACT complex acts as a histone chaperone that both destabilizes and restores nucleosomal structure. It facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II and transcription by promoting the dissociation of one histone H2A-H2B dimer from the nucleosome, then subsequently promotes the reestablishment of the nucleosome following the passage of RNA polymerase II

The coat has two main functions, the physical deformation of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into vesicles and the selection of cargo molecules. SAR1 controls the coat assembly in a stepwise manner. Activated SAR1-GTP binds to membranes first and recruits the SEC23 24 complex. These SEC23 24-SAR1 prebudding intermediates are then collected by the SEC13 31 complex as subunits polymerize to form coated transport vesicles. Conversion to SAR1-GDP triggers coat release and recycles COPII subunits (By similarity)

24141	ENOG4111WR7 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that specifically mediates the formation of 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains and plays a central role in DNA repair by facilitating cellular responses to DNA damage. It is unclear whether it also mediates the formation of other types of polyubiquitin chains. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is required for its tumor suppressor function. The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer coordinates a diverse range of cellular pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation to maintain genomic stability. Regulates centrosomal microtubule nucleation. Required for normal cell cycle progression from G2 to mitosis. Required for appropriate cell cycle arrests after ionizing irradiation in both the S-phase and the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Involved in transcriptional regulation of P21 in response to DNA damage. Required for FANCD2 targeting to sites of DNA damage. May function as a transcriptional regulator. Inhibits lipid synthesis by binding to inactive phosphorylated ACACA and preventing its dephosphorylation. Contributes to homologous recombination repair (HRR) via its direct interaction with PALB2, fine-tunes recombinational repair partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 repair machinery at DNA breaks. Component of the BRCA1-RBBP8 complex which regulates CHEK1 activation and controls cell cycle G2 M checkpoints on DNA damage via BRCA1-mediated ubiquitination of RBBP8 (By similarity)

34932	ENOG410XSFW Component of the ERMES MDM complex, which serves as a molecular tether to connect the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Components of this complex are involved in the control of mitochondrial shape and protein biogenesis and may function in phospholipid exchange. mdm10 is involved in the late assembly steps of the general translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM complex). Functions in the tom40-specific route of the assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins, including the association of tom40 with the receptor tom22 and small TOM proteins. Can associate with the SAM(core) complex as well as the mdm12-mmm1 complex, both involved in late steps of the major beta-barrel assembly pathway, that is responsible for biogenesis of all outer membrane beta-barrel proteins. May act as a switch that shuttles between both complexes and channels precursor proteins into the tom40-specific pathway. Plays a role in mitochondrial morphology and in the inheritance of mitochondria (By similarity)

38109	ENOG410ZRVJ Involved in mRNA export coupled transcription activation by association with both the TREX-2 and the SAGA complexes. The transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA is a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates histone H2B and is involved in the maintenance of steady-state H3 methylation levels. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. Has also a role in mRNP biogenesis and maintenance of genome integrity through preventing RNA-mediated genome instability (By similarity)

54613	ENOG41119RI Functions as an inhibitory receptor that plays a constitutive negative regulatory role on cytolytic function of natural killer (NK) cells, B-cells and T-cells. Activation by Tyr phosphorylation results in recruitment and activation of the phosphatases PTPN6 and PTPN11. It also reduces the increase of intracellular calcium evoked by B-cell receptor ligation. May also play its inhibitory role independently of SH2-containing phosphatases. Modulates cytokine production in CD4 T-cells, down- regulating IL2 and IFNG production while inducing secretion of transforming growth factor beta. Down-regulates also IgG and IgE production in B-cells as well as IL8, IL10 and TNF secretion. Inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as prevents nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B p65 subunit RELA and phosphorylation of I-kappa-B alpha CHUK in these cells. Inhibits the differentiation of peripheral blood precursors towards dendritic cells

The BRCA1-A complex also possesses deubiquitinase activity that specifically removes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin on histones H2A and H2AX. In the BRCA1-A complex, it is required for the complex integrity and its localization at DSBs. Probably also plays a role as a component of the BRISC complex, a multiprotein complex that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin. In these 2 complexes, it is probably required to maintain the stability of BRE BRCC45 and help the 'Lys-63'-linked deubiquitinase activity mediated by brcc3 brcc36 component

F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(1) domain and of the central stalk which is part of the complex rotary element. Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits

DNA base J is a hypermodified thymidine residue found in the genome of kinetoplastid parasites, which is localized primarily to repetitive DNA, namely the telomeres, and is implicated in the regulation of antigenic variation. Also specifically binds to base J-containing DNA (J- DNA). Involved in propagation and maintenance of DNA base J synthesis initiated by JBP2 by specifically binding already synthesized DNA base J and propagating J synthesis. Thymine dioxygenase activity and J-DNA-binding are independent functions

98519	ENOG410XYI0 Involved in mRNA export coupled transcription activation by association with both the TREX-2 and the SAGA complexes. The transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA is a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates histone H2B and is involved in the maintenance of steady-state H3 methylation levels. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. Has also a role in mRNP biogenesis and maintenance of genome integrity through preventing RNA-mediated genome instability (By similarity)

As a component of the meiotic nuage, plays a central role during oogenesis by repressing transposable elements and prevent their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity. Repression of transposable elements is mediated via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the repression of transposons. As a nuclear component, it is required for proper differentiation in the germline stem cell (GSC) lineage by repressing microRNA-7 (miR-7), thereby acting as an indirect regulator of bag-of-marbles (Bam). Acts by binding to the promoter of miR-7 gene and repressing its expression

145457	ENOG410Y1R8 Component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBN (MRN complex) which plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage and the maintenance of chromosome integrity. The complex is involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA recombination, maintenance of telomere integrity, cell cycle checkpoint control and meiosis. The complex possesses single-strand endonuclease activity and double-strand-specific 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which are provided by MRE11A. RAD50 may be required to bind DNA ends and hold them in close proximity. NBN modulate the DNA damage signal sensing by recruiting PI3 PI4-kinase family members ATM, ATR, and probably DNA-PKcs to the DNA damage sites and activating their functions. It can also recruit MRE11 and RAD50 to the proximity of DSBs by an interaction with the histone H2AX. NBN also functions in telomere length maintenance by generating the 3' overhang which serves as a primer for telomerase dependent telomere elongation. NBN is a major player in the control of intra-S-phase checkpoint and there is some evidence that NBN is involved in G1 and G2 checkpoints. The roles of NBS1 MRN encompass DNA damage sensor, signal transducer, and effector, which enable cells to maintain DNA integrity and genomic stability. Forms a complex with RBBP8 to link DNA double-strand break sensing to resection

164933	ENOG4112BIH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that specifically mediates the formation of 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains and plays a central role in DNA repair by facilitating cellular responses to DNA damage. It is unclear whether it also mediates the formation of other types of polyubiquitin chains. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is required for its tumor suppressor function. The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer coordinates a diverse range of cellular pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation to maintain genomic stability. Regulates centrosomal microtubule nucleation. Required for normal cell cycle progression from G2 to mitosis. Required for appropriate cell cycle arrests after ionizing irradiation in both the S-phase and the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Involved in transcriptional regulation of P21 in response to DNA damage. Required for FANCD2 targeting to sites of DNA damage. May function as a transcriptional regulator. Inhibits lipid synthesis by binding to inactive phosphorylated ACACA and preventing its dephosphorylation. Contributes to homologous recombination repair (HRR) via its direct interaction with PALB2, fine-tunes recombinational repair partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 repair machinery at DNA breaks. Component of the BRCA1-RBBP8 complex which regulates CHEK1 activation and controls cell cycle G2 M checkpoints on DNA damage via BRCA1-mediated ubiquitination of RBBP8

180057	ENOG410YYKB Functions as extracellular chaperone that prevents aggregation of nonnative proteins. Prevents stress-induced aggregation of blood plasma proteins. Inhibits formation of amyloid fibrils by APP, APOC2, B2M, CALCA, CSN3, SNCA and aggregation-prone LYZ variants (in vitro). Does not require ATP. Maintains partially unfolded proteins in a state appropriate for subsequent refolding by other chaperones, such as HSPA8 HSC70. Does not refold proteins by itself. Binding to cell surface receptors triggers internalization of the chaperone-client complex and subsequent lysosomal or proteasomal degradation. When secreted, protects cells against apoptosis and against cytolysis by complement. Intracellular forms interact with ubiquitin and SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes proteasomal degradation of COMMD1 and IKBKB. Modulates NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. Promotes apoptosis when in the nucleus. Inhibits apoptosis when associated with the mitochondrial membrane by interference with BAX-dependent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation (By similarity)

184221	ENOG4111C1J these ligands are up-regulated by stress conditions and pathological state such as viral infection and tumor transformation. Functions as docking site for PI3-kinase PIK3R1 and GRB2. Interaction of ULBPs with NKG2D-DAP10 triggers calcium mobilization and activation of the PIK3R1, MAP2K ERK, and JAK2 STAT5 signaling pathways. Both PIK3R1 and GRB2 are required for full NKG2D-HCST-mediated activation and ultimate killing of target cells. In NK cells, NKG2D-HCST signaling directly induces cytotoxicity and enhances cytokine production initiated via DAP12 TYROBP-associated receptors. In T-cells, it provides primarily costimulation for TCR-induced signals. NKG2D-HCST receptor plays a role in immune surveillance against tumors and is required for cytolysis of tumors cells

Then the PB-activated substrate is nucleophilically attacked by the selenol anion of component PA to transform it to a carboxymethylated selenoether and the respective amine. By action of component PC, acetyl phosphate is formed, leaving component PA in its oxidized state. Finally component PA becomes reduced by the thioredoxin system to start a new catalytic cycle of reductive deamination
